Student Sisyphys:

Inspired by Distress
Connected to calendar, journal, email, etc that communicates need to know information and optimizes your day. Used as a personal data miner for issues you want to know about. Consistent reminder about your internet habits.

For example,
when you wake up: good morning, I see you're a bit behind schedule. Let me realign your schedule in accordance. What event would you prefer to change, studying for math 3283 or the alloted time to work on homework for Yost?

May I please remind you that according to modern studies and from previous data, you need at least 10 hours of studying to achieve a perfect grade with 2 rem sleep cycles for optimal information retention. Proceed?

-----
I see you're using the internet for non study related behaviors during your study period. Would you like me to allot a 15 minute break right now and modulate the schedule accordingly?

-----
Hey, Sisyphus. I have a physics test coming up, can you generate me study materials?
Let me parse the internet and your school documents.
-----
Data analytics on behavior:
During your alloted focus time, your attention lasted around 10 min before use of stimuli and loss of focus, I've parsed the internet and believe you may find more focus and fufillment if you start listening to classical music while studying during those times
